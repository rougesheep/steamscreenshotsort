## Steam Screenshot Sorter

Sort Steam screenshots into folders based on game names written in powershell. It's probably awful. Uses the Steam api to get game names. Sort of works now.

## Requirements

Set up Steam to save screenshots elsewhere.
```
Steam > Settings > In-Game > Screenshot Folder
```
